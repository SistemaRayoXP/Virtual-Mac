# VirtualMac
A GUI for several Macintosh emulators

This project has the intention to 'merge' all the current classic Macintosh emulators a making a Graphical Front End for all.

The main idea came to me when I wanted to check out some apps in Mac OS but I had no Mac, so here comes the need of an emulator.
But almost all of them are splitted into different things and youu need one for Mac OS 7, other for OS 8 to 9.0.4, and other
for OS X 10.1 to 10.4 (And even OTHER for for 10.0 to 10.5). Do you understand my point? Why so many emulators and so many GUIs
and so many options. This, must be over, we NEED an universal FrontEnd for all plataforms, that, is the purpose of VirtualMac,
but as I only have Windows (By now), I need to anyone who is interested to help me to take this to macOS and Linux. The Universal
Unified Emulator must become true!

Now that you understand the point of this project, if you are a Mac enthusiast or a vintage computer enthusiast, and you know
coding, if you'd like where this goes, feel free to help us. We'd be glad to get your help!
